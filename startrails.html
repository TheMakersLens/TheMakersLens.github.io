                            You may think that you need lots of expensive high-end gear to capture startrails, however it's actually more achievable than you think! I've had great results just using an entry-level DSLR and a small tripod! 
                        <p>
                            My interest for startrails photography first began in 2020, and has since grown from there. I didn't even have a car until recently, so most of my photos were just taken in my local area! The one below features a kids climbing frame in a local park!

                           I hope this portrays just how easy it is to get into astrophotography! My guide will now go through the whole process so that you can get out and snap your own startrails!

                                <p>The camera needs to be able to take long exposure photos (needs to be able to hold the shutter open for at least 10 seconds).

                                I use a Nikon D3100 that I've had since 2014.

                                <li><h3>Intervalometer</h3></li>
                                <p>An intervalometer is needed for automatically controlling the camera's shutter, so that you don't have to manually take each photo and risk knocking the camera (which would ruin the end result).
                                    I use <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/RGBS-Shutter-Release-Intervalometer-Control-Black/dp/B078ST3XL3?crid=3DN17JV5O252A&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.r1Tvk-bvIMIB3NP7WqavLtnCUxVF_AhrH_Gcg7iqyFxv4urQS6n4yPT80OlX4m32dK7bOc_o68FAkkdXBikBfcrJFvnQuA682d3suoysksQ2X_CkhkimzC_xuUW689vI1WYjl80BoQJ9hIfmxl-NmMa0QW7hs92Z4w9xXfA-Y6WsbF4q-sByA0m8FEKmcp-Lgq0YsTbQOR2E9S-k5BOKd2zogb8DPMwSjAP1Vva6XDQ.Jo3DUNsoujS0tALDKA6wqb8U3AVB8sfR04I1JiWpa-8&dib_tag=se&keywords=intervalometer+nikon+d3100&nsdOptOutParam=true&qid=1734998394&sprefix=intervalometer+nikon+d3100%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-4" target="_blank">this one</a>, however, you'll have to find one that is compatible with your camera.

                                <li><h3>Tripod</h3></li>
                                <p>Any tripod should do the job, as long as it is sturdy and does not wobble.
                                </p>

                                <li><h3>Lens Warmer</h3></li>
                                <p>Lens warmers prevent the lens from fogging up due to condensation when shooting in cold, humid environments. I currently do not have one, but will be investing in one shortly as they are inexpensive, and will mean I don't have to wipe the camera lens constantly. Ideally, you do not want to touch the camera at all when you are capturing startrails because you can risk knocking the camera out of position!    
                                </p>

                                <li><h3>Spare Batteries</h3></li>
                                <p>If you are going to be shooting for a long time you probably want to bring some extra batteries for your camera, and maybe for the intervalometer too! Bear in mind however, that you can't change the batteries out once the camera has begun capturing the startrails, as this would risk moving the camera and ruining the end result.</p>

                            <p>As I mentioned earlier, you can basically shoot startrails anywhere! However, you may get better results if you take some factors into account.</p>                           
                            <ul>
                            <li><h3>Light Pollution</h3></li>
                            <p>Ideally you will want to set up your camera in a dark sky area, away from built-up areas as they are the biggest source of light pollution. The darker the sky is, the more stars will be visible to your camera, and the greater the end result should be. An interactive dark sky map can be found <a href="https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                            <p>    
                                Moon brightness should also be taken into account, as the sky will be darker when the moon is less visible. This can be checked online with sites such as: <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/phases/" target="_blank">Moon Phases - Lunar Calendar</a>.
                            </p>

                            <li><h3>Cloud Cover</h3></li>
                            <p>Clouds will ruin startrail images as they can block the light from the stars, causing a gap in the trail. Therefore, it's best to set up your camera in a location with forecast clear skies for the duration of the shoot. Cloud coverage can be checked online with sites such as: <a href="https://weather.metoffice.gov.uk/maps-and-charts/cloud-cover-map#?model=ukmo-ukv&layer=cloud-amount-total&bbox=[[41.50857729743935,-18.676757812500004],[64.49172504435471,10.678710937500002]]" target="_blank"> Met Office - UK Cloud Cover Map</a> and <a href="https://www.snow-forecast.com/maps/static/usa/6/cloud" target="_blank">snow-forecast.com US Cloud Forecast</a>.

                            <li><h3>Temperature/Dew Point</h3></li>
                            <p>Cold weather with a high dew point is bad as it will fog up the camera lens and subsequently ruin the end image. Condensation forms when the temperature of the lens drops below the dew point, therefore, using a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/KIWIFOTOS-Temperature-Regulator-Universal-Telescopes/dp/B0861XRZH6?ie=UTF8" target="_blank">lens warmer</a> is the best way to prevent this. However, in a pinch, you can just gently wipe the lens with a clean cloth in the few second interval between shots. Although, you must be very careful not to knock the camera, or else the photos will not line up once stacked in software later.
                            Dew point and temperature can be checked <a href="https://zoom.earth/maps/dew-point/" target="_blank">here</a>.

                            <li><h3>Foreground Items</h3></li>
                            <p>A good foreground can really enhance a startrails image, giving the sky a sense of scale. This is also a great opportunity for your own creativity to shine through. For example, I lined up the North Star (Polaris) with a kids climbing frame so that all the stars rotated around that point. I also captured a startrails photo from the end of my driveway facing towards my house which turned out great, but sadly I can't share that for privacy reasons.
                                Even just including trees in the image can look good though!

                                    Settings are still something I experiment with to this day, and the results can vary greatly depending on the camera. Nonetheless, I can still give you a starting point and an explanation of what you should change to achieve the desired effect.
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>ISO</b></li>
                                    <p>I typically set this between <b>100-800</b>. Increasing this will make the photo brighter and potentially reveal more stars, however may reduce the colour of the stars due to decreased dynamic range. Furthermore, setting the ISO too high may introduce more noise or 'grain' to the photos, although this heavily depends on your camera.</p>
                                
                                    <li><b>Focus</b></li>
                                    <p>The lens should be in <b>manual focus mode</b>, and should be set to <b>infinity focus</b>. This is the point where everything is in focus from a certain distance away.</p>
                                    
                                    <li><b>Aperture (also known as f-stop)</b></li>
                                    <p>It's best to set this <b>as low as possible</b> as this allows more light into the lens, meaning you can capture more stars. The lowest my lens will go is f/3.5 so this is what I always use.</p>
                                
                                    <li><b>Noise Reduction</b></li>
                                    <p>Some cameras will have a  noise reduction feature built in. It's usually best to <b>turn this off</b>, as the processing time may prevent the camera from taking each photo at the correct exposure length and interval. This is typically found in the settings menu within your camera.</p>
                                </ul>
                                <li><h3>Intervalometer Settings</h3></li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Delay</b></li>
                                    <p>This is just how long before the camera will take it's first photo after the start button has been pressed. I usually just set it to <b>a few seconds</b> so that I can put the intervalometer down before the first long exposure begins.</p>
                                    <li><b>Exposure Length</b></li>
                                    <p>This is how long the shutter will remain open for as it captures photos. I typically set it to <b>30 seconds</b>, however, I may experiment with longer durations in future. One of the main reasons I've only used 30 seconds was because I often shot in quite a light polluted area, and so the photos would be too washed out, even on my camera's lowest ISO setting (100).</p>
                                    <li><b>Interval</b></li>
                                    <p>This is the time between the long exposure photos. To ensure that there are no gaps in your startrails, you will want this to be <b>as low as possible</b>. However, how low you will be able to go depends on your camera, as some cameras will need a few seconds between photos. Therefore, this is something you will need to test. I have this set to 5 seconds, although ideally it would be set to 0-1 seconds.</p>
                                    <li><b>Quantity</b></li>
                                    <p>The more photos you take, the longer your startrails will be. I usually aim for around <b>100 30-second-long exposures</b> (taking just over 90 minutes with interval time accounted for). However, if the night is forecast to be clear and your batteries are fully charged, then you can set this number much higher and leave your camera to it!</p>

                        <h3>The Actual Process</h3>
                        <p>
                            Firstly, set up the camera on the tripod in a location where it will not move for the duration of the shoot. The ground should be stable, and the tripod should not wobble at all. In addition, you should also shelter it from strong winds. On a recent trip I achieved this by setting up my camera in front of my car, which can be seen below.
                        </p>
                        <picture class="photography-blog-images">
                            <img alt="Picture of a camera on a tripod in front of a car at night" height="300" src="images/startrails/cam-setup.jpg">
                        </picture>
                        <p>     
                            You can then begin by taking some photos of the foreground, you can experiment a bit with the settings here. I usually increase the ISO slightly, or use a longer exposure time so that the foreground is brighter. We may overlay parts of the foreground image on the startrails image later.
                        </p>
                    
                        <picture class="photography-blog-images">

                        <p>
                            Next, I apply the settings mentioned above, then I click start on the intervalometer and leave my camera to do its thing! Although, due to the high dew point on a recent excursion, I did have to wipe the lens every 5-10 mins just to ensure that it didn't get fogged up.
                            Even with a lens warmer, it's good practice to check on it every now and then to make sure it's still going, just don't shine any light in the lens!
                        <p>
                            That's it for taking the actual photos! Now you can head home to see what you've got, just be careful not to hit any sheep on your way back!
                        </p>

                            <h2>Editing the photos</h2>
                            
                            <h3>StarStaX</h3>
                            <p>The easiest way I've found to combine all the images you've captured is by using the free software <a href="https://markus-enzweiler.de/software/starstax/" target="_blank">StarStaX</a>. This has a simple user interface, and can generate your starstrails image with just a few clicks.
                            <p>Once you have the program open, <b>drag in the photos</b> you've captured. Then click <b>'start processing'</b>, which can be found on the top left side (see image below).
                            </p>
                            
                            <picture class="photography-blog-images">
                                <img alt="image showing the interface of StarStaX" height="300" src="images/startrails/starstax-with-arrow.jpg">
                            </picture>
                            
                            <p>It will then process the images one-by-one, building the startrails as it goes. Once it is finished, the output image can be saved by clicking <b>'Save as'</b> (also found in the top left).
                            <p>You can mess with the settings within StarStaX in the preferences section, however in my experience, changing these settings doesn't really have much of an impact on the end image.    
                            </p>

                            </picture>

                            <h3>Colour editing</h3>
                                <p>At this point you should have an image with clear startrails, however it may be a bit grey, and doesn't look like a nice dark sky with vibrant stars. This is normal, as distant light pollution can wash out the colour when the images are stacked. I usually resolve this with some simple editing.
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Brightness</b></li>
                                    <p>Reduce the brightness.</p>

                                    <li><b>Contrast</b></li>
                                    <p>Increase the contrast (this often makes the biggest difference).</p>

                                    <li><b>HDR Effect</b></li>
                                    <p>Increase this slightly if possible.</p>

                                    <li><b>Shadows</b></li>
                                    <p>Shadows should be lowered slightly.</p>

                                    <li><b>Saturation</b></li>
                                    <p>Increasing this can make your stars look more colourful.</p>

                                    <li><b>Warmth</b></li>
                                    <p>Lowering the warmth a bit can give the image a slight blue tint, taking away some of the greyness created by stacking the images.</p>
                                </ul>
                            <p>Nonetheless, as equipment and locations can create very different images, these settings are just suggestions. It's best if you play around with these settings until you get an image you're happy with.</p>
                            
                            <picture class="photography-blog-images">

                            </picture>

                            <p>You'll notice however that the buildings in the foreground are barely visible due to the low ISO used to capture the startrails. Therefore, I often composite in some of the foreground elements captured on location before the startrails were shot.</p>
                        
                            <h2>Foreground Editing</h2>
                            <p>Foreground elements can be added in using software such as photoshop, or its free alternative '<a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a>'.
                            Simply just cut them out and overlay them on top of the startrails image. As you captured them just before beginning the actual startrails, the foreground elements should line up with the background with minimal adjustment.
                            </p>
