                        <h2>How to do it</h2>
                        <h3>Designing the model</h3>
                        <p>
                            Firstly, download a blank funko pop model, like <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3357546" target="_blank">this</a> one I found on Thingiverse. We will take parts from this as we need them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next, as I am not skilled in 3d modelling, I used an AI powered 3d modelling website called <a href="https://www.meshy.ai/" target="_blank">Meshy.ai</a> to design the body of the model.
                            The prompt I had the most success with in the end was "headless character wearing jeans and a hoodie in the style of a funko pop model." However, you will have to experiment with different prompts to see what generates the best results. 
                        </p>
                        <picture class="blog-images">
                            <img alt="3d model of a headless funko pop" height="300" width="375" src="/images/funkopops/meshy.ai output.png">
                        </picture>
                        <p>
                            Also at this stage it may be worth including in the prompt that the character has closed fists, as it is much harder printing a character with individual fingers as they tend to snap off. I didn't do this the first time around and so spent longer editing the model later on.
                        <p>
                            Whilst you could attempt to generate the whole model using Meshy.ai, I found that the heads of the models were often scaled weirdly and so weren't in the iconic Funko Pop style. Furthermore, you are limited by the amount of models you can generate per month.
                        <p>
                            Meshy.ai gives you 200 free credits per month which equates to 15 sets of generations. Clicking generate will create 4 different models each time.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Designing the head</h3>
                        <p>
                            To get a blank Funko Pop head I used the split function on 3D builder to separate the head from the body of the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3357546" target="_blank">model</a> downloaded from Thingiverse earlier.
                            I then got back on thingiverse to search for defining features that I could add to my model, such as hair.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can think slightly outside of the box with this, as I found a 3D model of hair that was actually designed to fit with a lego minifigure, however, I resized it to fit on the Funko Pop head. The model I used can be found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6869845" target="_blank">here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <picture class="blog-images">
                            <img alt="3d model of a plain funko pop with hair" height="300" width="375" src="/images/funkopops/funko-pop-with-hair.png">
                        </picture>
                        <p>
                            You may also want to add accessories to the model as these can help make it recognisable as the person you are trying to recreate, such as yourself or a friend. I just added a bow to the hair, which I found on Thingiverse <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:277106" target="_blank">here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Combining the head and the body</h3>
                        <p>
                            Firstly, you will want to scale the body to Funko Pop size. I based mine off of a real Funko Pop I had laying around, and so I set the body to be 2 inches tall. You may want to adjust the height irrespective from width and depth to give it a typical Funko Pop build. 
                            The head should already be set to scale, but in case it's not it should be roughly 1.75 inches tall, 2.5 inches wide (eartip to eartip), and 2 inches in depth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To ensure that the head and body stayed securely together once glued, I made it so that the head fitted onto a neck on the body.
                            This can be achieved by adding a cylinder on to the top of the body, and subtracting a very slightly larger cylinder (due to 3D printing tolerances) from the underside of the head.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As mentioned, I struggled to print the fingers on the model that was generated. Therefore I cut the hands off of the model in 3D Builder, and replaced them with the closed fists from the Funko Pop template model downloaded from Thingiverse.
                        </p>
                        <picture class="blog-images">
                            <img alt="3d model of a headless funko pop with a neck and closed fists, and a funko pop head with a neck hole" height="300" width="375" src="/images/funkopops/neck-sidebyside.jpg">
                        </picture>
                        <h2>Printing the model</h2>
                        <p>
                            By this point you should have the model finished, ready to be put in the slicing software of your choice, and then printed. However, depending on your model, it may be difficult finding an orientation where it can be printed easily. 
                            For example, as my model had long hair, I figured it would be best to print the head upside down so that the model would not need supports. Nonetheless, this meant that the hair on the top of the head would not print well, as it was overhanging against the buildplate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, I split the head into two sections which could later be glued back together. This meant that both sections could be printed flat without the need for supports.
                            For the body, I printed it stood vertically with tree supports for the hands and the hood of the hoodie. 
                        </p>
                        <picture class="blog-images">
                            <img alt="3d model of a Funko Pop body with supports, and a Funko Pop head split into two in slicing software" height="300" width="375" src="/images/funkopops/models-in-cura-sidebyside.jpg">
                        </picture>
                        <p>
                            In terms of settings, I recommend printing with at least 50% infill on the body and 20% on the head so that the finished model has a similar weight to a real Funko Pop. I'd also recommend upping the wall thickness so that when the model is sanded down later you dont accidentally break through the outer layers. I used a wall line count of 4, for a thickness of 0.8mm.
                        <p>
                            Printing time for the body was around 4 hours, and the head took roughly 11 hours. Once printed, I glued the hair piece onto the head using <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/UniBond-Original-Heavy-Duty-Mounting-Adhesive/dp/B013XCFO6G/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=2XG96EUUFGZKY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.peSqOMIvPgGYBiCNDMVEBz9GLY-aFkuTBTW-VG_Y1j668ESdrldmar2NpNZdDn3lQo-fX231B0ERHm_hvTU0n9EnjekGH0kJDL125zSsfiNq7_q9HHJMXurGvRXEtJ3EHy62QfG73umwQWEKq3L44AofFDzu228LuGfd9Mn_at9LyFdjPJo_Sm_tr1AIi2OMHNVKczh3FthmnIZ8bBwEIN8U3dvBr9eJJIFUCZ6kVDd0UDeDiIR-lwyrTY7Ml6x3YfiW-xU7FLOLz-oy9MVJwDijaoMj1-ea2ecvKrq0-Bs.cJITF5mfHwOPX3zmjP1xyqrgUZr2-onyl6j5rMUrr0I&dib_tag=se&keywords=unibond%2Bno%2Bmore%2Bnails&nsdOptOutParam=true&qid=1734883654&sprefix=unibond%2Bno%2Bmore%2Bnail%2Caps%2C1881&sr=8-2-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1" target="_blank">Unibond No More Nails</a>, because that's just what I had laying around. However, any strong adhesive that works with plastics should be fine.

                            The filament I used was <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/SUNLU-Filament-Printer-Tolerance-Accuracy/dp/B088BC5QBJ/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2WA7O4R69IM89&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.8-bW40_APJpWJlykc6E7YspFjgW3Kvp5-VnuiPHFkkYjNWLicZ7V8eyJO1qLa5bVnXnvU4c0Cf_oBNF7BzomjiVhPdvxzbD4SiAmvqVyt25NAFFuZhQexmHAnjMj3yz-YASz62aY5VyajY5rAIWLFaehqbnoCeRUiVbn4AMDC56D1GlQsRT7Mks0dLi9kqR9llWVZBXVc6fdrNf4lJOWQMIO5f6EOErsAocatDDVz__yY3rfc8uUSW8MDVHq6sfrwu_ch4u8b0BBG8ewPqIz8ynriU--YnZ8LQ-HZj49r-Y52Q5xn6RNVzRpbiVfSGUDx2LjClXeaXx8BOrPvRzPldGwqVUlq3jMOPEdy1QqOkAxATvwWYAAJFii8YV9IB-XjeOtvUAhxqoCzd_TrjyTRW5cWyIN0zi_zZGg4qXz7IUz4Q_dA69z_5-4CcQW9GfC.MAThkt6M4b8eDrE3s8OY-u1IG2nDVDk2f6jGtIQL15s&dib_tag=se&keywords=sunlu+pla+wood&nsdOptOutParam=true&qid=1734883509&sprefix=sunlu+pla+woo%2Caps%2C104&sr=8-5" target="_blank">SUNLU PLA+ Filament (Wood)</a>.

                        <h2>Painting the model</h2>
                        <p>
                            First of all, sand the model down to remove any printing imperfections. A well-sanded model also ensures that the primer will adhere to the surface better. I used 80 grit and then 120 grit sandpaper, as it's just what I had laying around.
                        <p>
                            Then it's time to apply the primer. I sprayed on 4 layers of primer to try and cover the slight gap where the hair was glued on. However, in hindsight I probably would have benefitted from a dedicated filler primer like <a href="" target="_blank">this</a>, as it was still slightly noticeable even after painting.
                        <p>
                            When applying the primer it's best to follow the instructions on the spraycan, although most share similar instructions, such as spraying from _ cm away from the target. Nonetheless, if the primer does drip down, you can always lightly sand it down so that it's smooth again.
                        </p>

                            Once the model is fully primed and has been left to dry, it's time to paint! I recruited my sister for this as she's more of an artist than me, but she just used a selection of acrylic paints and fine-tip brushes to paint the entire thing.
                            Due to the awkwardness of the model, she found it best to paint one section at a time and then leave it to dry by resting it on an unpainted section. Thankfully, acrylic paints don't take a long time to dry and so the whole process just took a couple hours.
                        <p>
                            I then just used the same <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/UniBond-Original-Heavy-Duty-Mounting-Adhesive/dp/B013XCFO6G/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=2XG96EUUFGZKY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.peSqOMIvPgGYBiCNDMVEBz9GLY-aFkuTBTW-VG_Y1j668ESdrldmar2NpNZdDn3lQo-fX231B0ERHm_hvTU0n9EnjekGH0kJDL125zSsfiNq7_q9HHJMXurGvRXEtJ3EHy62QfG73umwQWEKq3L44AofFDzu228LuGfd9Mn_at9LyFdjPJo_Sm_tr1AIi2OMHNVKczh3FthmnIZ8bBwEIN8U3dvBr9eJJIFUCZ6kVDd0UDeDiIR-lwyrTY7Ml6x3YfiW-xU7FLOLz-oy9MVJwDijaoMj1-ea2ecvKrq0-Bs.cJITF5mfHwOPX3zmjP1xyqrgUZr2-onyl6j5rMUrr0I&dib_tag=se&keywords=unibond%2Bno%2Bmore%2Bnails&nsdOptOutParam=true&qid=1734883654&sprefix=unibond%2Bno%2Bmore%2Bnail%2Caps%2C1881&sr=8-2-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1" target="_blank">Unibond Adhesive</a> I used earlier, to glue the head onto the body.
                            However, if you want the head to be able to rotate, just don't glue it down! The pieces friction-fitted together quite well, so the head wouldnt even fall off and could rotate on the neck. However, I decided to glue it down anyway to make the model feel more solid.

                            And there we go! The model is finished! Now we only have to make the box!
                        </p>
                        <h2>Making the box</h2>
                        <p>
                            A comprehensive guide to making the box can be found <a href="https://popvinylfaq.com/2017/06/26/how-to-make-and-assemble-your-own-custom-a4-pop-box/" target="_blank">here</a>. I found the instructions easy to follow, and although I used photoshop to edit the box design, other free options such as GIMP should work.
                        <p>
                            For the character image on the box, I used the <a href="https://funko.com/pop-yourself.html" target="_blank">Funko Pop designer</a> on the official Funko Pop website to make a model that looked similar to mine. I then just downloaded it as an image and made adjustments to it in photoshop.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The box also provides a great opportunity for adding your own unique touch to the finished package. On mine I added a photo of my girlfriend's cat, as you can see below. If it is a gift you can also write a nice message on the underside of the box.
                        </p>
